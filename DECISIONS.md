DECISION-002 — 2026-07-18 — Egoric becomes the operational system of record
Status: Approved
Decision:
- Egoric owns operational CRM/ERP.
- LeozOps becomes a read-only intelligence platform.
- No duplicate CRM.
- No shared database.
- Sprint 1 scope: Egoric Snapshot → LeozOps Ingestion → CEO Brief. Nothing else.
- No deployment until Sprint 1 passes local end-to-end verification.
Reason:
Egoric is already deployed and used by employees. LeozOps now provides
intelligence instead of replacing CRM.
Consequences:
- Legacy standalone CRM roadmap archived.
- Integration-first architecture adopted.
- All future milestones follow this decision unless superseded by another ADR.
Process notes:
- Execution plan: `.hermes/plans/2026-07-18_egoric-integration-execution-plan.md`
  (v2, evidence-gated, dates removed, deployment deferred to Sprint 2).
- Sprint 2 must not start until Sprint 1 acceptance (gate G4) is recorded here.
- Implementation tasks are not yet created; a separate CEO go is required.
Owner: Leoz (Product Owner). Recorded by Hermes (PM).

DECISION-002 addendum — 2026-07-18 — Sprint 1A implementation authorized
Status: Approved (Leoz). EXECUTION ON HOLD pending Repository Identity Rule.
Decision: Begin Sprint 1A ONLY — implementation tasks exclusively for the
Egoric read-only snapshot endpoint (Egoric repository, test instance only,
gate G1). Sprint 1B and 1C tasks must not be created until Sprint 1A is
completed, Codex-reviewed, merged, and accepted.
Task breakdown: `docs/SPRINT_1A_TASKS.md` (T1–T6).
Repository identity ruling (Leoz, 2026-07-18): `agency-erp`
(leozvu/CRMegoric.git) is NOT the canonical Egoric repository. The canonical
ERP/CRM repository is `repositoryrealms`. The Repository Identity Rule was
added to GOVERNANCE.md; implementation may not begin until the canonical
repository's local path, remote, and branch are confirmed and its registry
row is marked CONFIRMED.
Owner: Leoz. Recorded by Hermes (PM).

DECISION-002 addendum 2 — 2026-07-19 — Canonical source, branch model, and deployment isolation
Status: Approved (Leoz).
Decision (option (a) of the production-lineage question):
- leozvu/repositoryrealms is the go-forward canonical ERP/CRM source.
- Sprint 1A targets repositoryrealms, not agency-erp/CRMegoric.git.
- `codex/realms-demo` is NOT an approved production branch; it is preserved
  as staging/demo.
- Protected production baseline branch `main` created from 76082dc (latest
  verified production-lineage commit, v3.36); GitHub branch protection
  enabled (PR + 1 approving review); set as default branch.
- Sprint 1A implementation branch `feat/leozops-s1a` created from main.
- Promotion flow: feat/leozops-s1a -> Egoric-only test/staging deployment ->
  Codex G1 PASS -> merge to main -> explicit CEO production approval ->
  Vercel CLI deploy to the Egoric project only.
- The integration feature flag and LEOZOPS_READ key must never be deployed
  to aim, vnecom, fretas, or egolive. The route is disabled by default in
  every deployment and enabled only via deployment-specific environment
  variables in the Egoric Vercel project (prj_Hh4aZEj9q3hvULaUfC4GwFvxYii9).
  See `docs/DEPLOYMENT_FLAG_ISOLATION.md`.
- Production deployment approval: NOT YET GRANTED.
Context: Production-lineage verification (GOVERNANCE.md) proved
repositoryrealms/codex/realms-demo contains the full production v3.x history
plus staging/demo commits; the live Egoric ERP runs at
erp-egoric.vercel.app as one of five businesses served by one codebase.
Hold conditions (all satisfied 2026-07-19; see GOVERNANCE.md):
main created from 76082dc; feat/leozops-s1a created; credential-file risk
verified resolved (untracked + gitignored in agency-erp, absent from
repositoryrealms); flag-isolation documented.
Sprint 1A remains ON HOLD pending explicit CEO release. No source code
modified.
Owner: Leoz. Recorded by Hermes (PM).

2026-07-18 — Egoric is the operational system of record; LeozOps becomes a read-only intelligence layer
Decision: Keep Egoric as the sole CRM/ERP and employee workflow system. Integrate LeozOps as a separately deployed, read-only API intelligence service for versioned KPIs, CEO Briefs, and advisory recommendations.
Context: Egoric is already deployed and used by real employees. LeozOps contains useful deterministic intelligence components but also duplicates clients, leads, campaigns, tasks, onboarding, and publishing responsibilities. Launching both as operational CRMs would create double entry, ownership conflicts, and production risk.
Rationale:
- Preserves existing employee workflows and gives every operational entity one owner.
- Reuses the highest-value LeozOps components without making LeozOps another ERP.
- A narrow REST export provides an auditable, versioned, revocable boundary.
- A separate LeozOps deployment and database limit blast radius.
- Read-only shadow operation makes correctness measurable before any UI exposure.
Decision boundaries:
- Egoric owns clients, leads, tasks, users, invoices, and operational workflows.
- External ad platforms own delivery facts; Egoric may later own a canonical campaign reference. LeozOps owns neither campaign master.
- LeozOps owns derived metric definitions/snapshots, briefs, and advisory recommendations.
- The pilot uses a dedicated `LEOZOPS_READ` GET-only, PII-minimized lead snapshot. It does not use a Director key, generic CRUD API, existing webhooks, queue, or direct database access.
- No write-back, autonomous external action, production DB write, shared database credential, double entry, or big-bang rewrite.
- The Egoric-native funnel is preserved; no historical conversion is claimed without stage history.
Supersedes:
- The prior assumption that M10 should deploy LeozOps as a standalone operational CRM for the Egoric organization.
- The prior sequencing assumption that real publishing or task automation is the next integration priority.
Does not delete:
- Existing CRM/task/email code or its historical test evidence. Those capabilities remain present but are excluded from the Egoric read-only integration deployment profile.
Implementation contract: `docs/EGORIC_INTEGRATION.md`.
Alternatives considered:
- Embed the full LeozOps application inside Egoric: rejected because it couples releases and duplicates domain logic.
- Use a background worker with direct Supabase access: rejected because it bypasses API authorization/audit and broadens production blast radius.
- Use Egoric webhooks first: rejected because delivery is not yet durable or replayable.
- Use a Director API key against generic `/api/v1/*`: rejected because the key also has write capability.
- Bidirectional entity sync: rejected because it creates two operational owners and conflict resolution requirements.
Owner: Leoz (Product Owner). Hermes owns sequencing; Claude Code owns implementation within the contract; Codex owns release QA.

2026-06-12 — M10 milestone state reclassification: local code PASS / deployment BLOCKED
Decision: Classify current M10 work as local code verified but deployment blocked. Do not mark M10 fully PASS until PostgreSQL smoke and live pilot verification are executed.
Context: Local verification is complete (159/159 tests green, typecheck clean) and M10.1 was committed. Codex review explicitly requires deployment evidence: real `npm run db:smoke:pg` output and recorded pilot verification on a live instance.
Rationale:
- Code verification and deployment verification are different gates. Promoting M10 to PASS without the deployment gate would misrepresent launch readiness.
- Delaying feature work until the gate closes prevents false progress and forces infrastructure/ops to be resolved.
Alternatives considered:
- Mark M10 PASS anyway: would hide a real risk and set false milestones-complete signal.
- Continue building new features while deployment is blocked: wastes feature work if infra fails.
Owner: Hermes (PM)

Remediation plan to close M10 deployment gate:
1. Provision PostgreSQL environment.
2. Run `npm run db:smoke:pg` against the real instance and record PASS or a specific blocker.
3. Deploy API in a real hosting environment.
4. Execute live pilot verification:
- `GET /ready` returns 200.
- `POST /onboarding` with admin auth creates tenant and issues token.
- Pilot tenant calls create campaign/lead/task.
- Pilot tenant reads briefs and recommendations against live data.
5. Record results: base URL, client_id, `/ready` result, live instance verification summary.
6. Only when both Postgres smoke and pilot verification are complete: mark M10 PASS in `CHECKLIST.md` and `ROADMAP.md`, then continue to the next milestone.

2026-06-12 — Milestone #10 implementation: client onboarding workflow + readiness probe
Decision: Implement the codeable M10 launch surface on the existing stack: onboarding service + admin route, readiness probe, `npm run onboard` CLI, and pilot runbook.
Context: M9 passed QA; M10 is current. The deployable code can’t be fully validated until a real PostgreSQL host is available, but the implementation surface is complete.
Rationale:
- Uses M7 auth/tenant model unchanged.
- Additive only: no schema redesign.
- `/ready` validates platform readiness from real infrastructure signals when deployed.
Alternatives considered:
- Build hosting/deploy automation into M10: out of scope; ops/hosting is env-specific.
- Add a users/identity table for operator logins: rejected; M7 per-client token model is sufficient for the launch operator.
Owner: Claude Code (Senior Dev), within the M10 scope.

2026-06-12 — M9 remediation complete: task validation and deterministic audit ordering
Decision: M9 Task Engine now passes QA after adding UUID-shape/gating validation before DB access, audit-note type/length guards, monotonic `seq` on `task_status_events`, composite unique order key `uq_task_events_task_seq`, and corresponding route/task+events coverage.
Context: M9 shipped initially with malformed input reaching the repository boundary and non-guaranteed audit ordering when rapid transitions shared millisecond timestamps. After review, the issue was patched and QA passed; `task_status_events` no longer relies on timestamp tie-breaking for read order.
Rationale:
- Front-door validation in the repository means malformed request values return 400 and never touch the DB.
- A 1-based monotonic `seq` per task makes the audit trail authoritative without depending on DB row-id insertion guarantees.
- Backward compatibility preserved: migration added columns with app-side assignment (no schema rewrite).
Alternatives considered:
- Rely only on timestamp + row-id ordering (no seq): rejected because it kept display order DB-dependent.
- Use timestamps alone with retry hacks: rejected because explicit sequence is simpler and deterministic.
Owner: Claude Code / Codex / Hermes (M9 QA loop)
